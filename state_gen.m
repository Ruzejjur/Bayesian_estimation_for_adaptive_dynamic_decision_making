function s_t = state_gen(distribution, seed)
%STATE_GEN generates state in time step t using distribution
%   INPUT:
%       distribution = probabilities of reaching state s_t:  p(s_{t}|a_{t},s_{t-1})
%       seed = seed for RNG, to recreate results
%   OUTPUT:
%       s_t = generated state in time step t
